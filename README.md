FAQs


(I)  - Is this wallet 
safe? 
 
 - Absolutely 
not! I am still 
learning how to 
code and you are 
just one big ‘ol 
doofus if you put 
any significant 
amount of money 
in this wallet. 


(II) - How did you make this if you don’t fully know how to 
code? 
 
 - I took the bizarrely affordable plebdev course by 
plebdevs.com. 


(III) - Isn’t the whole economic ideology of Star Trek 
antithetical to the mission of bitcoin? 
 
 - please chill out and don’t be such a downer.  It’s healthy 
to be challenged by contrary ideas. Plus, there are many 
other great themes in the show that are thought provoking.
